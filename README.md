Google Capstone Project

I analyzed a dataset for Bellabeat, a company that creates high tech products for womens health. The data from this dataset is fitness and health data from smart devices, specifically their Bellabeat app. I analyzed daily movement and sleep data because:
- Daily movement data gives insights on user enagement
- Sleep data is a core feature in Bellabeats device

The task is to analyze trends in smart device usage to understand consumer behavior with the goal of recommending marketing strategies for Bellabeat's product offerings.
